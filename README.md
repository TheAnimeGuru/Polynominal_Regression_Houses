# Polynominal Regression Model - House price prediction

This project is a flawed implementation of gradient descent for multi feature Linear Regression Models using numpy. This example uses [This dataset here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shree1992/housedata) to create a prediction for house prices (y) respectfully for each feature (e.g. bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft...) (x). This implementation includes Feature Normalization and Feature Regularization with non-linear features.

# Dependencies:
- Python 3.X
- `pip install numpy matplotlib pandas`

- To run simply execute `python index.py`
